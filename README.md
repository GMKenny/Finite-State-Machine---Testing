# Finite State Machine & Testing.
 This Finite State Machine is used to determine a given path based on input. 
 Each node has x amount of connection determined beforehand.  

# Main.
 In main 2 diffrent FCM are created and a node amount is given to determine the amount of nodes.
 After that the nodes are connected and the inputString can be processed to see the route it has taken.

# Unit testing.
 The unit test looks if the given functions work and that the outputs are as expected.
 To determine if the functions work wrong inputs are given for example: duplicate of a connection.
 This show that duplicates of connections are not possible and doesnâ€™t.
